# social-network-api

## Summary
In this project I built the backend of a social network API from scratch. It allows users to share thoughts, react to thoughts and create a friendslist. In the video walkthrough (see below) you can see some of its features in action like get all users/thoughts, get one usres/thought, create new user/ thought, update a user/ thought, delete a user thought and react and add firends.

## Tech
This projected uses JAvascript, Node.js, Mongoos, MongoDB, Nodemon, and Express.
